# Unity Manual Refresher
A tool for manual asset refreshing. If enabled, unity will no longer auto refresh and compile assets that have been changed. Useful if you don't want to compile every time you change the code slightly.

Default shortcut for manual refresh: Shift + C

The auto refresh toggle will change settings in preferences->asset pipeline.
